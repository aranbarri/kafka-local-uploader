# Kafka Local Files Uploader

**Monitors a Local directory** and **uploads new files to an Apache Kafka topic**, encoding them in Base64.

## Features

- Watches a local folder for new file creations.
- Encodes file content as Base64 and sends to a Kafka topic.
- Automatically renames files after upload (optional).
- Ignores `.ignore` and `.uploaded` files.
- Graceful shutdown handling.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Apache Kafka cluster

### Installation

An executable `.jar` file is provided. No need to build from source or use Maven.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a properties file (e.g., `config.properties`) with the following keys:

```properties
bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092
topic.name=your-topic-name
watch.folder=/path/to/watch/folder
modifySentFileNames=true
```

- `bootstrap.servers`: Kafka broker(s) to connect to.
- `topic.name`: Kafka topic to publish messages to.
- `watch.folder`: Local folder to monitor for new files.
- `modifySentFileNames`: If `true`, renames uploaded files to `filename.uploaded`.

---

## üèÅ Usage

Run the application:

```bash
java -jar KafkaUploader.jar /path/to/config.properties
```

### Notes:
- Only new files created in the `watch.folder` will be processed.
- Files are encoded in Base64 before being sent to Kafka.
- Uploading waits until the file copy is complete (based on file size stability).

---

##  Shutdown & Cleanup

- App listens for shutdown signals (e.g., Ctrl+C).
- Ensures the Kafka producer and watcher service are gracefully closed.
- Files that are uploaded can be renamed (e.g., `myfile.txt` ‚Üí `myfile.txt.uploaded`).

---

##  Ignored Files

The following files are skipped:

- Files ending with `.ignore`
- Files already uploaded (ending in `.uploaded`)
